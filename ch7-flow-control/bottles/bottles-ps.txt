99 Bottles of Beer
Pseudocoded by Jeff George, 10.1.15
After the exercise in Chapter 7 of Chris Pine's Learn to Program


This program prints the lyrics to the song, "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall"

This file is a first cut at pseudocoding the program; the final program is a bit more complex, because it handles the special cases of 1 bottle and 0 bottles much better.




SET counter = 99

WHILE counter > 0
  PRINT "counter bottles of beer on the wall,""
  PRINT "counter bottles of beer!"
  PRINT "if one of those bottles should happen to fall,"

  SET counter = counter - 1

  PRINT "counter bottles of beer on the wall!"
  PRINT newline
END while

PRINT "No more bottles of beer on the wall,""
PRINT "No more bottles of beer!"
PRINT "Go to the store, buy 99 more!"

SET counter = counter - 1

PRINT "99 bottles of beer on the wall!"
